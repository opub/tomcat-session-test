# Docker Compose to launch PostgreSQL, HAProxy and three Tomcat containers for session replication testing.
# The number of Tomcats is not critical but since the test page makes two requests it is better to have an 
# odd number so roundrobin of the requests for a single user doesn't always end up on the same instances.
